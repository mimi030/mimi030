## Hi there 👋

I’m a passionate developer who enjoys building projects that aim to make life a little easier. 

🔭 I’m currently working on exploring new tech stacks and building full-stack applications using Python (Django) and React frameworks like Next.js and Vue.js.

🌱 I’m currently diving deeper into AI technologies, cloud computing, and full-stack development.

🛠️ Skills & Tools I use: Python, Django, ASP.NET Framework, or frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and jQuery.

🧑‍💻 I also have experience with C# for backend development and enjoy experimenting with different frameworks.

📫 How to reach me: You may tag me on a GitHub issue.

⚡ Fun fact: I'm passionate about learning new things, drawing, sightseeing, and gaming. When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me going for walks.

### If you find my work helpful and want to support my journey, I’d be truly grateful for any sponsorship. Your support allows me to focus more on improving my projects and exploring new ideas. Thank you for being part of this wonderful community! 🌟
