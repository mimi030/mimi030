## Hi there 👋

I’m a passionate developer who enjoys building projects that aim to make life a little easier. 

- 🔭 Currently exploring tech stacks and developing full-stack applications with Python (Django) and React (Next.js, Vue.js).
- 🌱 Diving deeper into AI technologies and cloud computing.
- 🛠️ Skills & Tools: Python, Django, ASP.NET, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, jQuery, C#.
- 📫 How to reach me: You may tag me on a GitHub issue.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm passionate about learning new things, drawing, sightseeing, and gaming. When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me going for walks.

I’m always open to collaboration and contributing to impactful projects. If you find my work valuable, I appreciate your support—whether through feedback, contributions, or sponsorship—as it helps me continue improving and innovating. Looking forward to building great things together! 🌟
