## Hi there 👋

I’m a passionate developer who enjoys building projects that aim to make life a little easier. 

- 🔭 Currently exploring tech stacks and developing full-stack applications with Python (Django) and React (Next.js, Vue.js).
- 🌱 Diving deeper into AI technologies and cloud computing.
- 🛠️ Skills & Tools: Python, Django, ASP.NET, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, jQuery, C#.
- 📫 How to reach me: You may tag me on a GitHub issue.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm passionate about learning new things, drawing, sightseeing, and gaming. When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me going for walks.

If you find my work helpful and want to support my journey, I’d be truly grateful for any sponsorship. Your support allows me to focus more on improving my projects and exploring new ideas. Thank you for being part of this wonderful community! 🌟
